# Implementing EDF Scheduler
Earliest Deadline First (EDF) is a shecduling algorithm that adopts a dynamic priority-based preemptive scheduling policy, meaning that the priority of a task can change during its execution, and the processing of any task is interrupted by a request for any higher priority task.

## System Description
The purpose of this system is to design an EDF scheduler based on FreeRTOS.
The system runs on NXP LCP2129 microcontroller.

## Getting Started
### Executing program
Run the program simulated using Keil uVision5
